Like, a lot. Maybe even DSM-level likes. This is a picture of a liberty bell made out of lego. It is the fourth bell-themed art installation I have seen this far,which strikes me as excessive.<p />On the plus side, the concourse betwee B and A terminals has rocking chairs with power outlets spaced every ten or twenty feet, which is beyond cool.<p />That is all for now, Internet legions. I shall keep you all posted should any more notable events take place. :-)<p /></span></p>
