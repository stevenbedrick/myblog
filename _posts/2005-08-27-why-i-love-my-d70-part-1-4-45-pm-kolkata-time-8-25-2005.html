Taking pictures during a monsoon is a good way to get one's camera body a little bit wet. I'm pleased to report that the D70 body is water-resistant enough to take out in a rainstorm for a few minutes, provided one dries it off afterwards. Monsoons actually are good times for photgraphy, because the ambient temperature is lowered by five or ten degrees. This helps keep the camera's lens from fogging up. Of course, the heavy dark cloud cover reduces the light enough to require a higher-than-usual ISO sensitivity setting.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/13766433-112516410483698288?l=bedrickblog.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
