Singapore, 1:00 PM Local Time 8/19/2005<p />The Singapore airport is one of the swankiest airports I think I've ever seen. It feels like a very high-end mall&mdash; think Denver's Cherry Creek&mdash; and is simply huge. From the immigration paperwork ("Death For Drug Traffickers is Singapore's Law") I'd been expecting something much less... comfortable-feeling. Instead, we were greeted by a massive indoor fern garden and more free internet kiosks than you can shake a stick at (the connection speed is fast enough to use Skype quite effectively). There are plants everywhere, and all of them are real. Heck, there's even a <em>koi pond</em>. In the airport. A giant freaking koi pond. There's a roof-top sunflower garden, as well. Oh, and I almost forgot- there's a free movie theater, constantly showing a variety of American films (both classic and more recent).<p />We found some lunch... I got some sort of seafood-noodle-curry thing. It had all sorts of interesting marine wildlife in it... prawns, some unidentifiable fish-type thing, and who-knows-what-all-else, all in a slightly spicy fishy curry sauce. It was a tough call, as there are a ton of amazing-looking restaurants here. So far, I can report that what passes for Indian food in the US is very similar to what passes for Indian food in the Singapore airport. <p />The icing on the cake, though, is the free tour system. If your layover is more than a couple of hours long (ours is about nine hours), you can register for a free two- or four-hour sightseeing tour of the city. We're still about forty minutes early for ours, so I'm killing some time in a part of the airport that Panasonic has furnished with several dozen flat-panel televisions, each of which is set to a different sporting event somewhere in the world. They also have the largest touch-screen that I've ever seen, running something vaguely like Google Earth, only it only covers a few major world cities.<p />Basically, the Singapore airport is probably the single best airport that I've ever been in. Killing hours here is amazingly easy.<p />[Update: The free sightseeing tour was an excellent use of a couple of hours. It basically got us out of the airport, into the town, around a little bit, on a water-taxi ride around the harbor, and back to the airport. More airports ought to have similar things. Imagine how much better a six-hour layover at Chicago O'Hare would be if you could go on a tour of downtown.]<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/13766433-112452278546254794?l=bedrickblog.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
