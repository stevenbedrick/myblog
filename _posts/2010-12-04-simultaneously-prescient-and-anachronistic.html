<p>It's not often that I run across a quote that manages to be incredibly prescient and equally anachronistic at the same time. From a 1996 <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html"><em>Wired</em> interview with Steve Jobs</a>: <p /> </p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><br />There will be Web dial tone everywhere. <br /></blockquote><p><p /> "Dial tone"? I can't even remember the last time I read those two words.</p>
