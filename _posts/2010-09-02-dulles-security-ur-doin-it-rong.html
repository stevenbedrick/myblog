<p>From today&rsquo;s Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/31/AR2010083106133.html">Pakistani officials leaving in protest</a>.</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>A delegation of senior Pakistani military officials visiting the United States for a major defense conference headed home in protest Tuesday night after they said they were interrogated and rudely treated by security officials at Dulles International Airport.</p></blockquote><p>Apparently, the geniuses in Dulles:</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>detained the delegation for 2.5 hours and <em>refused to allow the officials to contact their embassy or the U.S. military officials who had invited them to visit</em>, according to a Pakistani military official who spoke on condition of anonymity. <em>[Emphasis mine]</em></p></blockquote><p>Yes, because <em>that</em> is the way to maintain quality relations with nuclear-armed allies whose population is getting increasingly sick off at our <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/23/AR2010082305107.html">assorted and sundry</a> military activities in their (literal) backyards.</p><p>The best part? One might ask, &ldquo;why were these Pakistani officials going to Tampa&rdquo;? Was it perhaps to visit the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/ever/">Everglades National Park</a>, or perhaps Tampa&rsquo;s fine <a href="http://www.tampamuseum.org/">Museum of Art</a>? Let&rsquo;s find out:</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>The Pakistani officers were originally en route to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa to attend the annual conference of the U.S.-Pakistan Military Consultative Committee, said Maj. David Nevers, a Central Command spokesman. He said Centcom officials hoped to reschedule the conference.</p></blockquote><p><em>headdesk</em></p><p>Well, you know, it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re fighting a massive war along these guys' border, or <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7963961/Nato-supplies-to-Afghanistan-hit-by-Pakistan-floods.html">depending on them for military supply routes</a>, or trying to help make sure that their <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/11644/isi_and_terrorism.html">questionable intelligence service</a> doesn&rsquo;t keep funding the Taliban, or anything like that- who cares if the conference gets delayed? What could we possibly have to talk about with them?</p>
