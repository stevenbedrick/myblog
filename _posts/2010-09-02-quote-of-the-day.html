<p>In an NPR article entitled <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125856586">&ldquo;Three Books for Surviving Graduate School&rdquo;</a>, Adam Ruben suggests that grad students read Alfred Lansing&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/9780786706211">&ldquo;Endurance: Shackleton&rsquo;s Incredible Voyage to the Antarctic&rdquo;</a> for inspiration. This is what Ruben had to say about the book:</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>Much like grad school, Endurance is a tale of optimists embarking blithely on a mission of discovery for discovery&rsquo;s sake, then becoming hopelessly entrenched in a situation that overwhelms them. The story also offers encouragement: No matter how boring you find your department&rsquo;s next seminar, at least you aren&rsquo;t clinging to an ice floe in the Weddell Sea while being attacked by a sea leopard.</p></blockquote><p>Truer words were never spoken.</p>
