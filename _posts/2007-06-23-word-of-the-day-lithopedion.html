OK, boys and girls, it's time to learn a new word: Lithopedion. Roughly translated from the Greek, lithopedion essentially means "stone child". Apparently, some ectopic or abdominal pregnancies result in fetuses that are too large for the mother's body to reabsorb. Very, very, very rarely, in this cases, the mother's immune system walls off the necrotic fetal tissue by calcification, after which the lithopedion can remain present and undetected for decades. While hacking away at our medical image retrieval program this afternoon, we ran across this <a href="http://www.mypacs.net/cgi-bin/repos/mpv3_repo/wrm/repo-view.pl?cx_subject=72398&amp;cx_image_only_mode=off&amp;cx_repo=mpv4_repo">radiograph</a> in our collection. Pretty wild, eh? Here's some further reading:<p />Lithopedion: laparoscopic diagnosis and removal.<br />Fertil Steril. 2007 May;87(5):1208-9.
