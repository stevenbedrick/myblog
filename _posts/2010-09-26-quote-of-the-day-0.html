<p>So, I&rsquo;m back from my annual three-weeks-of-foreign-gonzo-informatics trip, and will hopefully be posting some fun-filled stories in the coming weeks. For today, however, I&rsquo;ve got the following Quote of the Day, from the always-enjoyable <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/09/26/tax-frenzies-and-how-to-hose-them-down/">John Scalzi</a>:</p><blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>I really don’t know what you do about the “taxes is theft” crowd, except possibly enter a gambling pool regarding just how long after their no-tax utopia comes true that their generally white, generally entitled, generally soft and pudgy asses are turned into thin strips of Objectivist Jerky by the sort of pitiless sociopath who is actually prepped and ready to live in the world that logically follows these people’s fondest desires. Sorry, guys. I know you all thought you were going to be one of those paying a nickel for your cigarettes in Galt Gulch. That’ll be a fine last thought for you as the starving remnants of the society of takers closes in with their flensing tools.</p></blockquote><p>Mmmmm&hellip; Objectivist Jerky&hellip;</p>
