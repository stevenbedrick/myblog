OK, so, clearly, my plan of finishing up my India write-up within a few days of my last post was somewhat off the mark. I've got several half-written fragments of a write-up, but no clear timetable on finishing them. Grad school has completely borked my spare time, and as such almost everything's been put on hold. If worst comes to worst, I might be able to get them together over <span style="font-style: italic;">winter break</span>. Yes, that's right&mdash; I'm back in the oh-so-sweet embrace of academia now, and that means winter vacation is back, baby. Along with it comes student discounts on software (can you say $99 for IntelliJ? I knew you could...), Apple hardware, movies, transportation, car insurance, etc. etc. etc. All those great student perks that I thought were gone forever... are back. Score: Steven 1, Universe 0.<p />School itself is being quite nice, if horribly busy. Having homework again has taken a little bit of getting used to, but it's actually being quite enjoyable. Topics for future posts abound, so stay tuned (not that I know of anybody actually reading this, but you never know...).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/13766433-112933061730408985?l=bedrickblog.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
