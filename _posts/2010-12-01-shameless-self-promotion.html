<p>Yesterday, I gave my public defense of my dissertation, &ldquo;Improving access to medical knowledge using multilingual search interfaces&rdquo;. My department&rsquo;s administrative ninjas have posted the video of the public portion of the defense to the <a href="http://oninformatics.com/?p=503">department&rsquo;s blog</a>&ndash; check it out if you&rsquo;re curious and have an hour or two to kill!</p><p>Now that the defense is behind me, I might have a little bit more time for blogging&hellip; and we all know what that means! &ldquo;Notes on Travel, 2010 edition, Italy &amp; Cape Town.&rdquo; Yes, Internet hordes, I know it&rsquo;s been difficult for you, waiting these last few months for the definitive account of my exploits in La Serenissima and Cape Town- the media reports have blown everything way out of proportion, and those quotes were taken out of context, I swear.</p><p>Contrary to what you may have seen or read in the reports from the &ldquo;mainstream media&rdquo;, or in the numerous &amp; vicious libels that have been floating around the &lsquo;net, I was not personally responsible for the fluctuations in global prices on Proscuitto and Prosecco during the month of September. Furthermore, the bearded individual you all saw in the Youtube videos- the one riding through St. Mark&rsquo;s Square on a Ducati Monster clad in only an OHSU t-shirt and ranting loudly about machine translation- was <em>not</em> me, and anybody claiming that it was will be hearing from my attorneys. I look forward to setting the record straight- watch this space!</p>
